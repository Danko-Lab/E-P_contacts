parse:
    # If 'make_pairsam' is True, parsed Hi-C pairs will store complete 
    # alignment records in the SAM format (the resulting hybrid between the
    # .pairs and .sam formats is called '.pairsam'). Such files can be useful for
    # thorough investigation of Hi-C data. Downstream of parsing, pairsams
    # are split into .pairs and .bam, and .bam alignments are tagged with 
    # Hi-C related information. 'make_pairsam' roughly doubles the storage 
    # and I/O requirements and should be used only when absolutely needed.
    # NOTE: when 'make_pairsam' is False, the initial output of parsing is still
    # called '.pairsam' despite missing SAM alignments, for technical reasons.

    # related information is not necessary.
