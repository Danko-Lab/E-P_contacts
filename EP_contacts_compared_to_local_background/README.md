This directory includes the files required to calculate the ratio between contacts associated with each pair of enhancer
and promoter (or different sets of anchors) in the genome, within a defined genomic distance range from each other and their 
associated background contacts. The basis for this comperison is that the backgroung contacts are the contacts of the enhancer
with regions flanking the promoter and vice versa. Using this normalization strategy, we were able to ask whether enhancer-promoter
or contacts between CTCF binding sites are lost between different states or conditions. We also include a python file where we
visualized a comperison of these values for enhancer-promoter pairs between NELFB-FKBP12(F36V) mESCs treated or untreated with
dTAG-13 for 30 minutes, using a scatterplot.
